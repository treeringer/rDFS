# rDFS - Dendrochonology Field School Tutorial
This is a tutorial demonstrating many of the packages created for dendrochronological analysis in R. It is meant to facilitate learning at the Dendrochronology Field School. I will update as needed.

To get started, you can download a zipped file with all of the files to run in Rstudio on your own machine. Then, open the rmarkdown document "DFS_2024.rmd". This will walk you through how to load data and run packages. Alternatively, you could run the R script and load in your own data if you are comfortable using R.

Packages include:
+ dplR
+ treeclim
+ TRADER
+ DendroSync
+ dendroTools
+ burnr
+ defoliatR

Test datasets:
+ va013.rwl - Picea rubens chronology collected by Ed Cook in the 1980s near Mountain Lake, Virginia
+ Zion.fhx - Fire history collection from Chris Gentry and Peter Brown.
+ MTL_PRISM_ppt_tmean.csv - monthly precipitation and mean temperature data for Mountain Lake, Virginia. Downloaded from the PRISM Climate Group.
+ MTL_daily_PRISM_ppt_tmean.csv - daily precipitation and mean temperature data for Mountain Lake, Virginia. Dowloaded from the PRISM Climate Group.
